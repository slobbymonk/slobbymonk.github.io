          <p >
            <!-- General Process -->
            This project was made in 60 hours for a gamejam in a team of 4. We had 2 C++ programmers who didn’t have much experience in unity 
            and 2 unity developers including me, but the other unity dev was exclusively an artist so I had to both keep the project on track 
            as well as help the other programmers to program a lot.

        <h1 class="explanation-title">What did I learn</h1>
        <p >
          In my role of teamlead or unofficially "Supreme Team Leader", I learned how to manage a small team and make sure we were able 
          to make the tight deadline of the gamejam. I learned that to be a good lead you've gotta listen first and resolve the issue after.
