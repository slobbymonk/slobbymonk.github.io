          For this project I had the idea of making a trash robot. I wanted it to have a lot of personality so I gave it big eyes and a springy animation. I used Blender, Maya & Substance painter to make it and Unity to present it.

          This is easily my biggest project as I have spent countless hours perfecting my editing skills, thumbnail skills, copyrighting, etc... These videos are entertainment based and for every single one I make a new game.

          This model is completely hand painted and is supposed to depict a workshop, where an african tribesman makes toys for the village and sells them. The model was made in maya and the textures handpainted in photoshop.

        <p class="project-cards-text">The inspiration for this 3D model comes from mario kart, I wanted this kart to be able to fit right into a silly kart racing game.
          To make it I used a combination of Blender, Maya & Substance painter as well as unity to showcase it.

          This game was made in collaboration with a fellow youtuber named blackthornprod. In it 6 developers (including me) had to make a game without communicating. I was the first developer.

          Although it seems like a simple concept, dragging your mouse to throw a ragdoll. A lot of maths went behind making this work in a 3D world with a rotating & moving camera.
